# Bank-Account
A bank system that only gets more complicated 

## TODO LIST 
- [x] sort out password 
- [ ] sort out CLI
- [ ] make constructor and stuff prettier in general
- [ ] attach password to user not account => allows me to complete CLI to switch between accounts
- [ ] create unique object names for accounts
- [ ] add a timer to lock you out of your account after a period of time
